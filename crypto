Cryptocurrency, often abbreviated as "crypto," represents a revolutionary category of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security, making it challenging to counterfeit. Unlike traditional 
currencies issued by governments (fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. 
A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was launched in 2009 by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then,
thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications have been developed. Cryptocurrencies can facilitate secure online transactions,
represented by virtual "tokens," which are ledger entries internal to the system. Users can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies on various platforms, making them a novel and, for some, 
lucrative investment opportunity, albeit with high volatility and risk.
